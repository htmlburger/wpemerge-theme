_¹ Sage's Controller is more of a View Composer than a Controller._

_² Sage's Controller provides similar functionality but is limited to 1 composer (controller) per view and vice versa._

_³ Timber does not provide a front-end build process so you can implement whatever you prefer._

## Non-goals

- Taking over the WordPress main query.

  WP Emerge does __not__ take over the main query - it actively works with it.
- Taking over WordPress routing.

  WP Emerge does __not__ take over WordPress' routing - it actively works with it. The only exception to this are hardcoded URLs explicitly added by a user.
- Reinventing WordPress APIs using object-oriented interfaces.

  WP Emerge does not provide alternative APIs for registering post types, taxonomies or the like for little added benefit. Instead, it provides logical and handy places for developers to use core APIs.
- Using a third party engine by default.

  WP Emerge uses PHP by default in the same way WordPress does but with added features. Using a third party engine is entirely optional and requires installing an extension.
- Include most of Laravel or another framework.

  WP Emerge is lean and tuned for WordPress. While inspired by Laravel, it does not come with any `illuminate/*` packages. There are only 2 third party production dependencies:
  - `pimple/pimple` - The single-file PHP service container.
  - `guzzlehttp/psr7` - A PSR-7 Request and ServerRequest implementation.

## Requirements

- [PHP](http://php.net/) >= 5.5
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) >= 4.7
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 12
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or NPM

### Notable directories

#### `app/helpers/`

Add PHP helper files here. Helper files should include __function definitions only__. See below for information on where to put actions, filters, classes etc.

#### `app/src/`

Add PHP class files here. All clases in the `MyApp\` namespace are autoloaded in accordance with [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

#### `resources/images/`

Add images for styling here. Optimized copies will be placed in `dist/images/` when running the build process.

#### `resources/styles/frontend/`

Add .css and .scss files to add them to the front-end bundle. Don't forget to `@import` them in `index.scss`.

#### `resources/styles/[admin,editor,login]/`

These directories are for the admin, editor and login bundles, respectively. They work identically to the main `resources/styles/frontend/` directory.

#### `resources/scripts/frontend/`

Add JavaScript files here to add them to the frontend bundle. The entry point is `index.js`.

#### `resources/scripts/[admin,editor,login]/`

These directories are for the admin, editor and login bundles, respectively. They work identically to the main `resources/scripts/frontend/` directory.

#### `views/`

While views that follow the WordPress template hierarchy should go in the theme root directory (e.g. `index.php`, `searchform.php`, `archive-post.php` etc.), others should go in the following directories:
1. `views/layouts/` - Layouts that other views extend.
2. `views/partials/` - Small snippets that are meant to be reused throughout other views.
3. `views/` - Named [custom post templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/#creating-custom-page-templates-for-global-use) or views that don't fit anywhere else.

Avoid adding any PHP logic in any of these views, unless it pertains to layouting. Business logic should go into:
- Helper files (`app/helpers/*.php`)
- Service classes
- [WP Emerge Controllers](https://docs.wpemerge.com/#/framework/routing/controllers)
